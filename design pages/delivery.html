        <div class="txt first-txt"><p>This is the Delivery App that will only sell sweets and candy. The idea behind is to have a Wolt or Uber eats like app that you would only use when you want something sweet. I know you can also order sweets from the other delivery apps, but they have so much stuff that could be overwhelming if you only want sweets, therefore I propose an app that is focused on only one specific thing.</p></div>
